## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-pipeline/compare/v0.1.2...v0.1.3) - 2026-05-02

### Other

- migrate to centralized OxideAV/.github reusable workflows
- stay on 0.1.x during heavy dev (semver_check=false)
- branch on SourceOutput shape (Bytes/Packets/Frames)
- non-blocking round-robin so a slow track doesn't starve a fast one
- stream frames per-receive instead of drain-then-send
- adopt slim VideoFrame/AudioFrame shape
- pin release-plz to patch-only bumps

### Added

- DAG: `PacketSource` and `FrameSource` node variants matching the typed-source
  shapes in `oxideav-core::SourceOutput`. The executor probes every `Demuxer`
  leaf via `SourceRegistry::open`, then rewrites the node when the registry
  hands back `SourceOutput::Packets` / `SourceOutput::Frames` so downstream
  decode (for packets) or filter+sink (for frames) consumes the right shape
  without an intervening container demux or decoder.
- Executor: `SourcePump` enum + `open_source` / `resolve_source_shapes`
  helpers. `run_output` now branches per source shape — bytes goes through
  the historical demuxer chain, packet sources skip demux, frame sources
  skip both demux and decode and route directly into the filter chain (or
  the sink if no filter is declared).
- Test: `tests/source_variants.rs` exercises all three shapes end-to-end via
  in-tree mocks; each path produces the expected single audio frame.

### Changed

- Pipelined runner falls back to the serial path when any source resolves
  to a non-bytes shape. The staged-worker variants for `PacketSource` /
  `FrameSource` are tracked as follow-up work — RTMP and the generator
  both run fine on the serial path, which is the default for live playback
  on the typical thread budget.
